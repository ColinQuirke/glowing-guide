# Welcome to the solver wiki!

This is  personal project set up with a few goals in mind.
1. Become a better software engineer
1. Refamiliarize myself with some SAT and CSP algorithms and techniques I used to know well.
1. Learn some new skills

To do this I will practice and explore techniques like TDD, modern c++, refactoring and general clean coding principles. I will practice these techniques by creating solvers for SAT and CSP problems. And I will, in time, host those solvers on a public website backed by a public API.

This is intended to be the first solver, and I plan to implement the classic Davis–Putnam–Logemann–Loveland (DPLL) algorithm for testing boolean satisfiability. Details of the algorithm are available here - [en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DPLL_algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DPLL_algorithm)
